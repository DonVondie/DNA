This is a program that illustrates the effectiveness of using linkedlists over strings. 

It simulates the splicing of DNA, and shows run time efficiency of using linkedlists (where you only need to update the previous,
next, and potentially header nodes) over strings where you have to reprocess almost the entire string.
